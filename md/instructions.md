### Statistic Chronological Camparison
See the chronological camparison between two statistic by drawing regression linear. Here are some tips.
 
- If the value is too far away from the regression linear (more than the the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value), then it will counts as an outlier. The outliers are showed as points.

- If some outliers seems lay along with the regression linear, you can zoom in and find out it is not actually in the line but just because that the value of that statistic is relatively too small.

- If you click the button and choose a statistic with no reaction in the chart, it means that this data is missing. If both statistic 1 and 2 are missing, there will be a blank plot.

### Grouped comparison
