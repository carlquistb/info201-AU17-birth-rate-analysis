### Statistic Chronological Camparison
See the chronological camparison between two statistic by drawing regression linear. Here are some tips.

- If the value is too far away from the regression linear (more than the the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value), then it will counts as an outlier. The outliers are showed as points.

- If some outliers seems lay along with the regression linear, you can zoom in and find out it is not actually in the line but just because that the value of that statistic is relatively too small.

- If you click the button and choose a statistic with no reaction in the chart, it means that this data is missing. If both statistic 1 and 2 are missing, there will be a blank plot.

### Grouped comparison
Make comparison between seven regions in four database. All the countries are grouped into seven regions: East Asia & Pacific, Europe & Central Asia, Latin America & Caribbean, Middle East & North Africa, North America, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa.

Countries in same region often have similar environment, topography, cultural background and economic development.

- The data used here comes from the average value of various countries in specific regions.

- Choose specific year and the data base you want to see the differences between different regions. You will find a pattern in it.

- You can pay attention to the relaitonship between birth rate and GDP. Compare the grouped comparison result to the country comparison result.
