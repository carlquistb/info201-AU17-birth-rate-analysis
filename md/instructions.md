### Brief Introduction:
This project will illustrate birth rates and their tendencies for over 200 countries from 1960 to 2015. Further, the report will go in depth over the relationship between birth rate and economic growth in certain countries and regions, by comparing the rates of birth, population growth, and GDP growth.

In this interactive report, you can search through area and time to obtain specific birth rates, population growths, and GDP measurements. In addition, we will consider the **immigration phenomenon**, because it serves to increase a country's  population, which indicates a similar function as the newly born population. In this report, we will illustrate the bidirectional relationship between global immigration and economic growth.

### Target users of this report:

- Scholars who are doing research on (1) global and country birth rate changes; (2) the relationship between birth rate and economic growth; (3) the relaitonship between birth rate and national living standard in specific regions and countries. (4) global immigration trend and its impact on economic growth.

- Readers who want to know more about the verification and application of **Demographic Dividend Theory** proposed by David E. Bloom and Jeffrey G. Williamson. This report is going to discuss the scope and conditions for application of this theory. What's more, the report may be able to suggest future action on demographic policy in several certain countries with dominant international status.

### World Map Explorer

- collect individual data points. 
- This visualization is not meant to provide insight, as much as back up the regressed and summarized data in other parts of the report. 
- For instance, if you are looking to support an outlier in the regression tab, you can find that year and country on this map. If you are wondering what countries in Africa account for such a large birth rate, view individual contributors here.

### Statistic Chronological Camparison

See the chronological camparison between two statistic by drawing regression linear. Here are some tips.

- If the value is far away from the regression linear (the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value is large), then it will be an outlier. The outliers are shown as points.

- If some outliers seems lay along with the regression linear, you can zoom in and find out it is not actually in the line but just because that the value of that statistic is relatively too small.

- If you click the button and choose a statistic with no reaction in the chart, it means that this data is missing. If both statistic 1 and 2 are missing, there will be a blank plot.

### Grouped Comparison

Make comparison between seven regions in four database. All the countries are grouped into seven regions: East Asia & Pacific, Europe & Central Asia, Latin America & Caribbean, Middle East & North Africa, North America, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa.

Countries in same region often have similar environment, topography, cultural background and economic development.

- The data used here comes from the average value of various countries in specific regions.

- Choose specific year and the data base you want to see the differences between different regions. You will find a pattern in it.

- You can pay attention to the relaitonship between birth rate and GDP. Compare the grouped comparison result to the country comparison result.


### Questions Answered in this app

All the quesitons below are answered by statistical analysis.
- Global / region / specitic country birth rate, population growth rate, GDP growth rate tendency from 1960-2015

- Deviations during the period and the reasons for the bias. (eg. huge global events) And we can conclude several factors that have strong influence on birth rate.

- The relationship between GDP growth and birth rate in scale of global / region / country.

- Ellaboration of the **Demographic Dividend Theory**'s appliance. And how it applied to the Demographic Policies nowadays according to the data analysis results.
