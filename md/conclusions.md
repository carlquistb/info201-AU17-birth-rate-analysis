### World data analysis

**Blue** : Birth rate (world average)

**Yellow**: GDP growth rate (world average)

**Red** : Population growth rate (world averge)

According to the world data tendency,
- Birth rate is continously decreasing.
- poplulation growth rate is slightly decreasing. But due to large popluation base, the increasing volumn is still substantial.
- GDP growth rate continusly fluctuating for the lastest 50 years. But it keeps above of the o line. Only in 2009, the world GDP growth reached the bottom, which is very close to zero. In 2008, global economy was threatened by worldwide financial crsis. We slipped into capital winter.
- Relationship
-- On the world level, birth and GDP rates have little corelation with each other. The world population and GDP growth rates appear constant during these 50 years.

### Region comparison
- Sub-Saharan Africa maintains high birth rates. East Asia experiences droping brith rates. North America and Europe remain to be the two regions with thelowest birth rates.
- As for the population growth, the Middle East & North Africa hold the highest population growths. Sub-Saharan Africa's population growth rate rocketed, due to less war, better medical conditions and international contributions.
- There is a changing trend in regions' GDP growth rate. North American GDP growth plunged in these 50 years, but the changing development pattern from developing country to developed country accounts for this.

### Country Statistic Chronological Comparison
- Birth rate has a positive relationship with GDP growth in most of the cases.
- Population growth rate does not experience coordinated development (aka non-synchronous development) with birth rate. For further analysis, the death rates over this time period should be considered.

### Conclusion:
- Birth rate and GDP growth rate have a stronger relationship within a small region, especially analysed on the country granularity. The Theory of **Demographic Dividend** is more applicable within the country granularity.
- Birth rate has a notably positive correlation with GDP growth in most of our cases.
- Birth rate has a direct impact on future working age groups, which is the main drive of economic development.
- An increasing birth rate will lead to **Demographic window**, a period of time in a nation's demographic evolution when the proportion of population of working age group is particularly prominent. The growing birth rate will prolong this demographic window, maintain a country's economic development, and slow down the speed of aging population.
