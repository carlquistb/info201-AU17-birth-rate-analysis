#requirements for the project proposal:

1. Create **at least 5** GitHub Issues as your first set of steps to take in the project.  You should assign these to individual group members to complete 

2. What will be the format of your final product (Shiny app, HTML page or slideshow compiled with KnitR, etc.)?

3. How will you be reading in your data (i.e., are you using an API, or is it a static .csv/.json file)?

4. What types of data-wrangling (reshaping, reformatting, etc.) will you need to do to your data?

5. What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project (no need to list common libraries that are used in many projects such as dplyr)

6. What questions, if any, will you be answering with statistical analysis/machine learning?

7. What major challenges do you anticipate?
