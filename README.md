# info201-AU17-birth-rate-analysis
Final project group for Informatics 201, introduction to data analysis and technical methods in Informatics.

Hey! So, for next week, lets try to complete the following:

1. Compile a list of the questions we are going to ask.
Lets update the readme file on github with a table describing the data set that we need before we can answer that question, and a brief description of the visualization we will make.

2. compile all the data sets (.csv) that we are going to use.
upload the .csv files in a /data/ folder on the github repository. 
Also in the README.md file, create a table describing the columns currently in the csv files.

This week, we will not worry about any of the analysis or other work in R, just compile our resources. Go team!
