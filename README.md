# info201-AU17-birth-rate-analysis
Final project group for Informatics 201, introduction to data analysis and technical methods in Informatics.

Hey! So, for next week, lets try to complete the following:

1. Compile a list of the questions we are going to ask.
Lets update the readme file on github with a table describing the data set that we need before we can answer that question, and a brief description of the visualization we will make.

2. compile all the data sets (.csv) that we are going to use.
upload the .csv files in a /data/ folder on the github repository. 
Also in the README.md file, create a table describing the columns currently in the csv files.

| local path | type | rows | columns | source |
| ---------- | ---- | ---- | ------- | -------|
| data/birth_rate.csv | csv | 265 | "Country Name", "Country Code", "Indicator Name", "Indicator Code", "1960", "1961", through "2016", "2017" |
